It consists of a programming task as well as a report.


### Experiment Operators / Parameters:

##### Mutation
    - Definitely.
##### Crossover
    - Definitely.
##### Population Size
    - Definitely, maybe dependend on chromosome size
##### Tournament Size / Ratio to Pop Size
    - Definitely. Ratio between tournament size and population size is probably the one that matters rather than the tournament size alone
##### Replacement Operator
    - Definetely as it will change how the worst solution graph behaves
##### Crossover and Mutation probability
    - Definitely
